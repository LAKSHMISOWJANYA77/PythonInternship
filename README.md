# PythonInternship
Codsoft Python Internship â€“ Project Collection
This repository contains Python programs I developed during my Codsoft Python Internship, focusing on problem-solving, logical thinking, and hands-on coding. Each program demonstrates the application of Python fundamentals, control structures, and standard libraries to build functional solutions.
Project Overview
1. Basic Calculator
Description:
A command-line calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations based on user input.
Skills Applied:
*User input handling with input() and type casting
*Conditional statements (if, elif, else) for operation selection
*Arithmetic operators for computation
*Output formatting for results.
2. Random Password Generator
Description:
Generates a secure, random alphanumeric password of user-defined length.
Skills Applied:
*Use of string and random modules for character selection
*Dynamic password length control via user input
*String manipulation with join()
*Basic randomness for security.
3. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Description:
An interactive terminal-based game where the player competes against the computer in Rock-Paper-Scissors rounds.
Skills Applied:
*Random number generation for computer moves (random.randint)
*Conditional logic to determine the winner
*Looping constructs (while) for multiple rounds
*User interaction with dynamic game flow.
